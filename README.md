# WarcSearcher
A Python tool that performs regex searching iteratively over the contents of warc.gz files.

## Setup
### Parameters
`zip` - Saves all files that generated a match from the WARC to a zip file. Results are separated by definition. Disabled by default out of consideration for disk space, be mindful of this if you have many definitions to account for.

More TBD

## Future Development
* Migrate configuration based global variables to a config file
* GUI?
* HTML output?
